### Day 1: October 26, 2021
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked through my Java training course on Udemy. 

**Thoughts:** I like Java. As a statically typed language, it has given me the ability to code stronger code and think about how certain things work within a coding language. I appreciate the OOP nature of it.
